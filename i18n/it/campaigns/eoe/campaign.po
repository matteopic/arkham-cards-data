Each part is its own game with its own setup and resolution.\n"
"After completing one part of a scenario, the campaign guide directs the investigators to a Checkpoint that instructs them how to proceed. If the investigators wish to proceed directly to the next part of the scenario, the Checkpoint will instruct them how to clean up the game to prepare for the next part of the scenario. If the investigators wish to take a break and resume playing during their next game session, the Checkpoint will instruct them to record information in the Campaign Log that makes setup for the next session quick and easy."

msgid "Frost Tokens"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This expansion introduces a new type of chaos token: the frost ([frost]) token. At the start of the <i>Edge of the Earth</i> campaign, the chaos bag contains only a few relatively harmless [frost] tokens, if any. As the expedition continues, depending on the decisions the investigators make and the events that unfold, more [frost] tokens may be added to (or removed from) the chaos bag, altering the difficulty of every test the investigators perform. The more frost tokens are added to the chaos bag, the more crippling their effects become.\n"
""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first [frost] token revealed from the chaos bag during a skill test has the following effect: \"-1. Reveal another token.\" If another [frost] token is revealed from the chaos bag during the same test, immediately end the \"reveal chaos tokens\" step of the skill test and resolve the test as an automatic failure. <i>(Return all revealed [frost] tokens to the chaos bag after the test ends.)</i>\n"
"<i>For example: Bob investigates and there are two [frost] tokens in the chaos bag. During Bob's first investigation attempt, he reveals a [frost] token. This reduces his skill value by 1 and causes him to reveal another token. The next token he reveals is a +1, resulting in a total of 0 from both tokens. Bob succeeds! Emboldened, Bob attempts to investigate a second time. This time, he reveals a [frost] token, followed by a second [frost] token. Bob must immediately stop revealing tokens and resolve the investigation as an automatic failure.</i>"
msgstr ""

msgid "No more than eight total [frost] tokens can be included in the chaos bag and/or sealed on cards in play at any given time."
msgstr ""

msgid "A [frost] token revealed outside of a skill test has no effect on its own unless otherwise specified by a card effect."

msgid "A [frost] token added to the chaos bag remains in the chaos bag from scenario to scenario unless removed by a card or game effect. The app will track these additions/removals automatically."

msgid ""
"This campaign includes an encounter set of 16 weaknesses, each with the title \"Tekeli-li!\" These cards are shuffled together to form a special Tekeli-li deck during the setup of each scenario of this campaign.\n"
"Like normal weaknesses, if one of these cards is added to an investigator's deck, it becomes a part of that deck and stays with that investigator from scenario to scenario. However, the resolution of each Tekeli-li! weakness instructs the investigator to return it to the Tekeli-li deck (removing it from their own deck). As a result, the number of cards in the Tekeli-li deck varies based on how many of these weaknesses are in each investigator's deck.\n"
"<i>Note: While all Tekeli-li! cards share the same title, they may have differing effects.</i>"

msgid "Partner"
msgstr ""

msgid "Partner is a keyword ability that appears on the nine story assets in the <i>Expedition Team</i> encounter set. Each of these assets represents a powerful ally whom investigators can bring along during scenarios in this campaign to improve their chances of success. However, bringing an asset with the partner keyword endangers that asset, with the risk of losing them permanently."
msgstr ""

msgid "At the start of each scenario in this campaign, each investigator is given the option to choose a partner asset and put it into play. Partner assets cannot be added to an investigator's deck. An investigator may choose a different partner (or no partner) to bring each time they are given this choice."
msgstr ""

msgid "A partner asset cannot leave play unless it is defeated (for example, it cannot be discarded by card effects unless it is explicitly defeated). If an investigator is defeated, any partner asset they have with them is also defeated."
msgstr ""

msgid "If a partner asset is defeated, remove it from the game. Then, cross off that character's name in the Expedition Team section of the Campaign Log."
msgstr ""

msgid "Damage or horror on a partner asset is recorded in the Expedition Team section of the Campaign Log at the end of each game. <i>(The Campaign Guide will instruct you when to do this.)</i>"
msgstr ""

msgid "If an investigator resigns from a scenario, their partner asset leaves play, but is not defeated. Keep all damage and horror on it, as it will be recorded in the Campaign Log after the game ends."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each time an investigator fails a skill test while attempting to evade an enemy with the alert keyword, after applying all results for that skill test, that enemy performs an attack against the evading investigator. An enemy does not exhaust after performing an alert attack. This attack occurs whether the enemy is engaged with the evading investigator or not."
msgstr "Se un investigatore fallisce una prova di abilità tentando di eludere un nemico con Allerta, dopo aver applicato tutti i risultati relativi a quella prova di abilità, quel nemico effettua un attacco contro l'investigatore che ha tentato di eludere. Un nemico non si esaurisce dopo aver effettuato un attacco di allerta. Questo attacco si verifica a prescindere dal fatto che il nemico sia impegnato con l'investigatore che tenta di eludere o meno."
